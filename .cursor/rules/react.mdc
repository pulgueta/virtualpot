## React-Specific Rules

Cursor rules in React provide intelligent navigation and manipulation capabilities designed specifically for React development. These rules help you work more efficiently with React components, hooks, and JSX syntax.

### Component Navigation

- Navigate between component definitions and their usages
- Jump to hook declarations and dependencies
- Move between JSX elements and their props
- Quick access to component lifecycle methods

### Smart Selection

- Select complete JSX blocks and expressions
- Expand selection to include component props
- Smart hook usage and dependency selection
- Select complete component definitions

### Code Manipulation

- Quick component creation and refactoring
- Automated prop type management
- Hook declaration and cleanup optimization
- JSX structure manipulation

## Best Practices

- Use component-aware navigation for better code organization
- Leverage hook-specific cursor movements
- Utilize JSX-aware selection patterns
- Follow React component lifecycle patterns

## Examples

```jsx
import type { FC, PropsWithChildren, ReactNode } from "react"

interface AnotherComponentProps {
    leftIcon?: ReactNode;
}

const AnotherComponent: FC<AnotherComponentProps> = ({ leftIcon }) => {
  return <h1>{leftIcon}</h1>;
}

interface MyComponentProps extends PropsWithChildren {
    // props
}

const MyComponent: FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ children }) => {
  return <h1>{children}</h1>;
}

interface HeaderProps {
    title: string;
}

const Header: FC<HeaderProps> = ({ title }) => {
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}
